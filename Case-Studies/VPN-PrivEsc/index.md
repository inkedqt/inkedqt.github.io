# VPN & Privilege Escalation — Case Study

**Assessor:** inkedqt • **Version:** 1.0

> This is a generalized, platform-agnostic case study derived from a lab scenario. It contains no hostnames, IPs, or flags.

---

## Executive Summary
An internet-facing VPN service exposed **IKE Aggressive Mode**, enabling capture and **offline cracking** of the pre-shared key (PSK). Using the recovered PSK to authenticate, an attacker obtained a foothold and discovered a **sudo host option** path to **root** on the target host. The combination yields full system compromise, credential exposure, and potential lateral movement into internal networks.

**Overall Risk:** **High**  
**Key Recommendations:** Disable Aggressive Mode or use certificates/MFA; enforce strong PSKs with rotation; update and restrict `sudo` to explicit commands; centralize logging/alerting on VPN and sudo events.

---

## Scope & Assumptions
- **In scope:** Internet-exposed VPN/IKE service; reachable host after VPN access; host-level privilege escalation.  
- **Out of scope:** DoS, third-party providers, physical access.  
- **Constraints:** Black-box approach with standard wordlists and public tooling; minimal-impact verification of PoCs.

## Methodology (Condensed)
1. **Recon:** UDP/500 (ISAKMP/IKE) & UDP/4500 (NAT-T) identified.  
2. **IKE Testing:** Attempted Main vs Aggressive Mode; captured Aggressive Mode exchange for offline cracking.  
3. **Foothold:** Validated recovered PSK/credentials; established host access.  
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Enumerated sudo behavior; verified `-h <hostname>` path to root shell.  
5. **Validation:** Read-only checks where feasible; gathered evidence and remediations.

## Findings

### FN‑01: IKE Aggressive Mode with Crackable PSK — **High**
**Category:** Weak cryptographic configuration (CWE‑326)  
**Description:** The VPN gateway supports **Aggressive Mode**, which leaks enough data to allow **offline PSK cracking**. With common wordlists, the PSK was recovered and accepted by the service.  
**Impact:** External attackers can obtain VPN/host access and pivot internally.  
**Likelihood:** High • **Severity:** High  
**Evidence (generalized):**
```
ike-scan -A --pskcrack=out.txt <target>
psk-crack -d <wordlist> out.txt -> PSK recovered
```
**Remediation:**
- Disable **Aggressive Mode**; prefer **Main Mode** with **certificate-based** authentication and/or **MFA**.
- Enforce strong, non-dictionary PSKs; implement rotation and account lockouts.
- Monitor IKE probing and failed handshake patterns in SIEM.

---

### FN‑02: Sudo Host Option Allowed Root Shell — **High**
**Category:** Privilege management misconfiguration (CWE‑266)  
**Description:** The target host permitted a `sudo` **host option** path to spawn an interactive root shell (e.g., `sudo -h <hostname> -i`) without a tight command allow-list and/or due to a vulnerable build.  
**Impact:** Full privilege escalation to **root** on the host → credential theft, service manipulation, and staging for lateral movement.  
**Likelihood:** High • **Severity:** High  
**Evidence (generalized):**
```
/usr/local/bin/sudo -h <trusted-host> -i  # yielded root shell
```
**Remediation:**
- Update `sudo` to the latest stable version; remove duplicate/custom builds.
- Restrict `sudoers` to **specific commands**; disallow interactive shells (`!SHELLS`), enforce TTY and logging.
- Ship sudo logs to SIEM; alert on unusual options (e.g., `-h`) and failed sudo attempts.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK (Mapping)
- **T1078 — Valid Accounts:** Access via recovered PSK/credentials.  
- **T1548.003 — Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (Sudo and Sudo Caching):** Misuse of sudo options to escalate.

## Recommendations (Prioritized)
1. **0–7 days:** Disable Aggressive Mode or move to certificate-based auth; rotate PSK and any dependent credentials; patch `sudo` and lock down `sudoers`.  
2. **8–30 days:** Add VPN rate-limiting and lockouts; centralize auth via RADIUS/IdP with **MFA**; enable sudo audit logs & alerts.  
3. **31–90 days:** Annual VPN hardening review; baselined config management; periodic red-team checks for privesc vectors.

## Retest Plan
After remediation is deployed in a staging/production-like environment, rerun IKE mode validation and sudo misuse tests. Document results as **Fixed / Partially Fixed / Not Fixed**.
